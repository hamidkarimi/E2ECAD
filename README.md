End-to-End Compromised Account Detection

The usersid_label_split.csv file contains the dataset. Due to the Twitter constraints, we can not release the plain text of the tweets. In this file, you can find tweets, their corresponding labels (compromised or not compromised account) as well as the split (test, train, or dev).

The source code will be uploaded soon.

Please cite the following papers if you use either the dataset or the source code.
